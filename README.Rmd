Making It Easy to Make Better Passwords

![](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/password_strength.png)
# Goals

* Use [EFF dice based algorithm](https://www.eff.org/dice) to generate high entropy passwords
* Add helper functions to customize password to meet corporate password policies.
  - must contain both upper/lower case letters
  - must contain a number
  - must contain special symbol
* ability to render directly to clipboard to be pasted into password manager or other forms  The goal of passwdr is to ...

## Installation
<!--
You can install the released version of passwdr from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("passwdr")
```
-->

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("actuarialvoodoo/passwdr")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example, eval=FALSE}
library(passwdr)
## basic example code
passphrase()

# sometimes password rules to have upper case and numbers and symbols

passphrase() %>% 
  add_token_between_words(
    shuffle(
      add_upper_alpha(), 
      add_symbol(), 
      add_number(size = 2)
    ), 
    position = 0)  


```
